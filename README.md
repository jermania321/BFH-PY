## How it Works ?

When the user first loads the website, they are greeted with a log in/sign up screen.

Existing users can sign in with their email and password, however new users must create an account before proceeding.

Once the user is logged in, they are greeted with the conversion page.

Here, the user uploads the their desired music file(less than 5MB due to current server resource limitations) and presses the upload button.

Once the file is uploaded(speed may vary depending on your internet connection), the user will be taken to the convert page where they must press the convert button to start the conversion process.

The conversion process will now begin and we must simply wait for the computer  to do it's analytical magic.

Once the conversion is complete, an option to donwload the video will show up, clicking on which downloads an mp4 file which the user can play whenever they want.
